# What Makes This Autoclicker Special?

What makes this auto clicker unique is that you won’t even notice it’s running while you’re playing. It works very differently from other macros you’ve seen before.

# How It Works (With Default Settings)

When you click three times within 200 milliseconds, the macro activates. Once the macro is running, each click you make will trigger two additional automatic clicks. So, if you click once, it will register as three clicks in total.

The macro will stop after 1 second of no clicking. Since the macro is triggered by clicking quickly (three times under 200ms), it will only activate during fast, combat-related clicking. In other situations, like breaking a bed or buying items, you’ll still click normally.

What this means is that the macro acts as a support to your regular clicking. It adds more clicks in between your normal clicks.

# Can I Get Banned for Using This?

You won’t get banned for using this macro as long as you don’t set the settings too high (like 100 CPS). Since the macro depends on your clicking to work, it’s no different than real clicks.

# What Do These Settings Do?

There are many settings, and here’s what they all do:

### Click-Specific Settings:

• **Number of clicks to simulate**: This controls how many clicks the macro will simulate after you click (default is `2`, meaning it adds `2` clicks for every normal click you make).

• **Delay time between simulated clicks**: This sets how long the delay will be between the simulated clicks (default is `50ms`).

• **Double-click detection time**: This is how fast you need to click (3 clicks within `200ms` by default) to trigger the macro. You can adjust this time to change how quickly the macro activates.

• **Inactivity reset time**: If you don’t click for the specified time (default is `1000ms`), the macro stops working. You’ll need to trigger the macro again to make it simulate clicks.

• **Number of clicks to trigger double-click**: This sets how many clicks you need to make to trigger the macro (default is `3` clicks within `200ms`).

### Tickbox Settings:

• **Enable Left/Right Click**: The macro can work with both left and right clicks, and you can choose to disable either one.

• **Enable "Only When Minecraft is Active"**: This option makes the macro only run when Minecraft is the active window. It won’t interfere with other applications. The default executable it detects is `javaw.exe`, but if you use a custom client, it may need modification in the source code to work.

• **Mimic Realistic Click**: This option makes each simulated click have a different delay time, making the clicks seem more natural. You can adjust the range of delays.

• **No Delay Mode**: This option "removes" the delay between clicks, but there is still a small delay due to AutoHotkey limitations.

• **Hold Click Mode**: This setting is useful for bridging. When you start the macro with right-click, you can hold the right mouse button to continuously place blocks.

• **GUI/Close Hotkey**: Its like how the name says. It lets you change the keys to make the gui open/close. Default keybinds are `Alt + C` and `Alt + V`.

#### Also just a little reminder, when you change something on the settings, a new file called `settings.ini` is created. It stores your settings and when you open the macro again your settings will just stay as it was.

# How to Download the Macro? 

• There are 2 variants of the macro. One is on the `.ahk` format while the other one is on the `.exe` format.

• If you have AutoHotkey installed, you can use the `.ahk` file (Or preferably the `.exe` file as well). If you don't you can use the `.exe` file since AutoHotkey already comes injected inside it. (If you're gonna change stuff on the code, you need to use the `.ahk` variant)

You can download both from the [Releases](https://github.com/Alpointernet/Alpointernets-Legit-Macro/releases) page.
